Waterfall Way is one of NSW’s most scenic coast-to-tablelands rides, climbing steadily from humid coastal air into cool New England country. The road winds through dense rainforest near Dorrigo, past multiple waterfalls and deep gullies, before opening into fast, flowing sections across the plateau toward Armidale.
