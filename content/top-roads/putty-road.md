One of NSW’s classic long-distance twisty roads, Putty Road cuts through the heart of Wollemi National Park with a steady mix of fast sweepers and tighter technical sections. It feels remote despite its proximity to Sydney, with very few towns and long stretches of uninterrupted riding. Best enjoyed at a smooth, disciplined pace, Putty is a favourite for linking Sydney to the Hunter while delivering a proper day-ride sense of escape.
