intro: Late summer run up to Kangaroo Valley, to run the loop around Macquarie Pass.
---
This ride intends to integrate with the [Macquarie Pass loop](/top-roads/kangaroo-valley-macquarie-pass-loop/) turning this into a weekend ride.

Kick off will be from Gunning, with backroads to Crookwell. Originally going to Wombeyan Caves then out to Bowral via the Wombeyan Caves Road. However the road is currently closed on the eastern side until at least mid 2026 due to collapse.

Instead, we'll run down to the caves and back to Taralga, then head down to Canyonleigh and across to Moss Vale and down to Kangaroo Valley for the night.

Sunday morning we'll do the Macquarie Pass loop counter clockwise and make a left just before getting back to Kangaroo Valley to head south to Nowra and on to Nerriga. From there, it'll be onto Tarago and onto the flats around Lake George up to Collector for a final beer and the backroad down to Gundaroo.
