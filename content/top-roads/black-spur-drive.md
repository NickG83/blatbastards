A short but intense strip of rainforest tarmac cutting through the heart of the Yarra Ranges. Black Spur Drive is all about rhythm and precision, with near-constant corners under a dense canopy of mountain ash. It’s best treated as a technical linking road rather than a destination in itself, shining when paired with Marysville or Reefton Spur loops and ridden with respect for damp surfaces and heavy traffic.
