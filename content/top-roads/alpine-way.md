A true high-country pass through the Snowy Mountains, the Alpine Way links alpine villages, river flats, and sweeping mountain corners in one continuous ride. Hairpins near Thredbo give way to fast, flowing sections across open country before dropping into the Upper Murray. It’s a rewarding ADV and touring route that delivers big scenery and real elevation change, but demands respect for cold conditions, wildlife, and rapidly changing weather.
