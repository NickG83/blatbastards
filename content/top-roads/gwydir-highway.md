The Gwydir Highway is a classic high-to-low mountain crossing that trades constant intensity for space, scenery, and flow. Starting on the cool New England tablelands, the road drops through Gibraltar Range and Washpool country before spilling out into the warmer Clarence Valley near Grafton. Long sweepers, gentle elevation changes, and extended forest sections make it an easy rhythm ride rather than a technical workout.
