A classic Hawkesbury River loop built around quiet lanes, heritage pubs, and old-school cable ferries. This ride trades speed for atmosphere, winding through river flats, bushland ridges, and convict-era settlements before dropping into St Albans for a well-earned stop at the Settlers Arms Inn. It’s an easygoing ADV and touring loop that shines as a social ride or relaxed day out, with just enough twisty backroads to keep things interesting.
