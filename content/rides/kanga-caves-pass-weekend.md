This ride intends to integrate with the [Macquarie Pass loop](/top-roads/kangaroo-valley-macquarie-pass-loop/) turning this into a weekend ride.

**Saturday**

Yass → Crookwell → Taralga → Wombeyan Caves (out-and-back) → Taralga → Canyonleigh → Bundanoon\
*(Approx. 300 km)*

We’ll kick off from Kaffine in Yass after breakfast, with stands up at 1000.\
Saturday is intentionally a lighter day on the kilometers, so we’ll ease into the weekend with a scenic backroads run through Crookwell and across to Taralga.\
The original plan was to continue via Wombeyan Caves and then through to Bowral via Wombeyan Caves Road, but the eastern side remains closed (currently expected until at least mid-2026) due to road collapse.\
Instead, we’ll do a run down to Wombeyan Caves and return to Taralga for lunch, then continue south through Canyonleigh and across to Bundanoon for the night. If the light is good, we'll go out to Sunrise Point Lookout, before topping off tanks and heading to overnight accommodation.

Overnight stop: Bundanoon

**Sunday**

Bundanoon → Macquarie Pass Loop (clockwise) → Gerringong → Kangaroo Valley → Camberwarra Lookout → Nowra → Nerriga → Tarago → Lake George flats → Collector → Gundaroo\
*(Approx. 400 km)*

Sunday starts with the Macquarie Pass loop ridden clockwise. We'll stop for a quick coffee and a pie from the famous Robertson Pie Shop before heading into Mac Pass. Once done we'll cruise toward  Gerringong for a proper brunch at Sea Vista cafe.\
From there, we’ll head back toward Kangaroo Valley, get the obligatory photo at the Hampden Bridge, then double back a few kilometers and take the right turn to head south for coffee at Camberwarra Lookout before continuing through to Nerriga and a stop at the pub for anyone who's still hungry or needs some fluids...\
We’ll then continue through to Tarago, then ride out across the Lake George flats and up to Collector, before taking the backroad down to Gundaroo, where the ride wraps up with a farewell drink at the Gundaroo Inn and everyone can head off their separate ways.
