A long, open tablelands highway linking dairy country, high plains, and classic New England towns. Thunderbolts Way is about rhythm rather than intensity, with fast sweepers, big skies, and very little congestion once you’re away from towns. It’s an excellent distance ride for ADV and touring bikes, ideal for settling into a steady pace while covering serious ground between the coast, the Barringtons, and the Northern Tablelands.
