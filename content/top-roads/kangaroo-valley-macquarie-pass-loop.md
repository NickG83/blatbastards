A compact but varied loop combining tight rainforest hairpins, rolling valley farmland, and classic South Coast scenery. The descent into Kangaroo Valley and the climb over Macquarie Pass deliver technical, engaging riding, balanced by relaxed cruising and excellent food stops in Berry and Robertson. It’s an ideal half-day ride that rewards smooth control, especially in shaded sections where damp surfaces and traffic can catch out the unwary.
