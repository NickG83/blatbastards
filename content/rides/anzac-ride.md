intro: This ride concept wasn't my own, but the brain child of the Australian
  Iron Butt Association. The original intent from their perspective was to ride
  through 5 towns, in order, to spell ANZAC, culminating at the ANZAC Day
  Service at the Australian War Memorial in the Canberra.

Being an Iron Butt ride, it's supposed to be >1000 Miles in <24hrs, at which point the start location ***could*** be Adelaide. However this is the *light version*, doing about half that distance. 

Key stops to make the ANZAC acronym:

1. Avalon, VIC
2. Newham, VIC
3. Zeerust, VIC
4. Albury, NSW
5. Canberra, ACT
