intro: "Late spring run into the high country, down to the coast, through the
  Yarra Valley finishing in Melbourne for Adrian's 50th birthday party. Looking
  to be 5 days total, starting on Wednesday 30th October; racking up around
  2000KMs. Epic back roads, some dirt, plenty of twisties; the areas we're going
  to at this time of year - heaven on earth with a bike. "
