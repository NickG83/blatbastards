A classic Blue Mountains ridgeline ride linking Sydney’s outer northwest to the Central West. Bells Line of Road delivers flowing sweepers, cool-climate scenery, and easy access to orchards, lookouts, and mountain cafés along the way. It’s less technical than the Great Western Highway but still demands attention for fog, slow traffic, and sudden weather changes, making it a reliable and scenic connector rather than an all-out attack road.
