This ride intends to integrate with the [Macquarie Pass loop](/top-roads/kangaroo-valley-macquarie-pass-loop/) turning this into a weekend ride.

**Saturday**

*Yass → Crookwell → Taralga → Wombeyan Caves (out-and-back) → Taralga → Canyonleigh → Bundanoon*

*Approx. 300 km*

We’ll kick off from Kaffine in Yass after breakfast, with stands up at 1000.

Saturday is intentionally a lighter day on the kilometres, so we’ll ease into the weekend with a scenic backroads run through Crookwell and across to Taralga.

The original plan was to continue via Wombeyan Caves and then through to Bowral via Wombeyan Caves Road, but the eastern side remains closed (currently expected until at least mid-2026) due to road collapse.

Instead, we’ll do a run down to Wombeyan Caves and return to Taralga for lunch, then continue south through Canyonleigh and across to Bundanoon for the night.

**Overnight stop: Bundanoon**

**Sunday**

*Bundanoon → Macquarie Pass Loop (clockwise) → Gerringong → Kangaroo Valley → Nowra → Nerriga → Tarago → Lake George flats → Collector → Gundaroo*

*Approx. 400 km*

Sunday starts with the Macquarie Pass loop ridden clockwise, with the aim of stopping in Gerringong for brunch.

From there, we’ll head back toward Kangaroo Valley for a coffee stop, then double back a few kilometres and take the right turn to head south toward Nowra, before continuing through to Nerriga for a later lunch.

After lunch, we’ll continue through Tarago, then ride out across the Lake George flats and up to Collector for a final beer at the Bushranger Hotel.

We’ll finish with the backroad run down to Gundaroo, where the ride wraps up and everyone can head off their separate ways.
