This ride intends to integrate with the [Macquarie Pass loop](/top-roads/kangaroo-valley-macquarie-pass-loop/) turning this into a weekend ride.

**Saturday**

Kick off will be from Yass at Kaffine for breakfast around 1000. We're not doing a high km count day, so starting easy. We'll take backroads to Crookwell and across to Taralga. Original intent was to go to Wombeyan Caves then through to Bowral via the Wombeyan Caves Road. However the road is currently closed on the eastern side until at least mid 2026 due to collapse.\
Instead, we'll run down to the caves and back to Taralga for lunch, then head down to Canyonleigh and across to Moss Vale before winding down to Kangaroo Valley for the night.\
*(Approx. 300KMs)*

**Sunday**

Sunday morning we'll do the Macquarie Pass loop clockwise, intent being to have brunch at Gerringong before heading back toward Kangaroo Valley and making a left just before getting back to where we started, heading south to Nowra and then on to Nerriga. \
From there, we'll run through to Tarago and out to the flats around Lake George up to Collector for a final beer at the Bushranger Hotel and the backroad down to Gundaroo, before going our separate ways.\
*(Approx. 400KMs)*
