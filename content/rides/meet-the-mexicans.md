This trip was crafted to catch up with some of the boys from Victoria, making sure we take in some top roads to get there and home. 

**Day 1;** Out of Canberra, across to Captains Flat taking the backroad down to Numerella. From there its back on black top for a run to Bombala 

There is a decision point now, you can take Imlay Road which is awesome (per map), though you'll have more time on the Princess highway once you hit the coast. The other option is to stay on the Monaro Road and come out at Cann River. It's a good road too, just less so than Imlay.

Finishing the day at Marlo.

**Day 2;**  Head up to Orbost from breakfast, then into the forest on Bonang Road. This is 50/50 dirt / tar, but typically in very good condition due to logging in the area. Into Delegate and onto Bomballa, before forking right onto The Snowy River Way, through Maffra and onto Dalgety. You have another option here, either stay on Dalgety Road and into Berridale, or turn left just out of Dalgety, over the water crossing and follow Rockwell Road to Berridale. From Berridale, take Middlingbank Road through to Adaminaby, then onto Shannons Flat up to Tharwa and home!
