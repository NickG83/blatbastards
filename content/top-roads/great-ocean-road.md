One of Australia’s most iconic coastal roads, the Great Ocean Road threads cliff edges, surf beaches, and pockets of temperate rainforest along Victoria’s southern coastline. The riding itself is flowing rather than technical, rewarding smooth timing over outright speed, with constant scenery and frequent towns breaking up the run. Best enjoyed early or mid-week, it’s a world-class touring ride that delivers spectacle in every direction — provided you respect the traffic and changing coastal conditions.
