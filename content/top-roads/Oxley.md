Legendary twisty highway from the coastal plains near Wauchope up through rainforest and ridge country to Walcha through the New England Tablelands. Worth staying overnight in Port Mac then hitting this in the morning with the sun at your back. \
You'll probably be tired of all the corners (something >300 of them) so grab some caffeine at Gingers Creek Roadhouse closer to the top. \
We tip our hats to the local BMW dealership, [Rock Motorcycles](https://www.rockmotorcycles.com.au/) in Port Macquarie , who hooked us up with new rubber at a moments notice first thing Saturday morning despite being fully booked out for other work.
