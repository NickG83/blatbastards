An iconic coastal and escarpment run that blends rainforest canopy, cliff-edge views, and open ocean riding into one compact route. The Grand Pacific Drive is less about outright speed and more about timing and flow, with highlights like Sea Cliff Bridge and Bald Hill breaking up shaded forest sections through the Royal National Park. Traffic and enforcement are common, but ridden early or mid-week it’s a scenic, high-reward link between Sydney and the South Coast.
