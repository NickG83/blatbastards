This one came about by just randomly browsing the area North of Yass for backroads. I had the "Coffee" button selected and in the middle of vast farmland "[Red Robin Nursery](https://redrobinnursery.com.au/)" popped out. \
From there I plotted some backroads starting in Yass, which turned out to be a pretty fun route. "C" road blacktop that was pretty twisty in places (though poorly sign posted in parts!) before transitioning into well maintained dirt roads. 

Given the northbound route, Red Robin Nursery is actually in a perfect spot. You've just done 50+KM of dirt and about ready for a caffeine top up. Once you hit the black top at the church on Boorowa Rd, hang a hard right and the Nursery is only a KM or so down the road, well sign posted. It's a top spot to relax under massive shade trees and your phone will have "No Service" so just sit back and unwind.

Back on the road, heading east for ~10KMs before the right turn onto Wheeo Rd and more fast flowing dirt. Some fences were down when I went through and livestock in areas on the side of the road, so just be aware. The Bulleys Crossing link road to Rugby Rd, despite being a faint line on a map is actually fine - I was expecting something nasty. Running down to Dalton via Rugby Rd, it's hard to go past the Royal Hotel for a cold beer and a bit of lunch before following the train lines back toward Yass.

All up, it's only about 170 KMs, 2/3rds of which is high speed dirt.
