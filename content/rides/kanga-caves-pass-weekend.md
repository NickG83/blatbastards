intro: Late summer run to Kangaroo Valley, the the loop around Macquarie Pass,
  including Wombeyan Caves.
---
This ride intends to integrate with the [Macquarie Pass loop](/top-roads/kangaroo-valley-macquarie-pass-loop/) turning this into a weekend ride.

**Saturday**

Kick off will be from Gunning around 1000. We're not doing a high km count day, so starting easy. We'll take backroads to Crookwell and across to Taralga. Original intent was to go to Wombeyan Caves then out to Bowral via the Wombeyan Caves Road. However the road is currently closed on the eastern side until at least mid 2026 due to collapse.

Instead, we'll run down to the caves and back to Taralga, then head down to Canyonleigh and across to Moss Vale before winding down to Kangaroo Valley for the night.

*(Approx. 300KMs)*

**Sunday**

Sunday morning we'll do the Macquarie Pass loop clockwise and make a left just before getting back to Kangaroo Valley to head south to Nowra and on to Nerriga. From there, it'll be onto Tarago and out to the flats around Lake George up to Collector for a final beer at the Bushranger and the backroad down to Gundaroo.

(Approx. 400KMs)
