intro: >-
  "The Snowy Ride" used to be a big motorcycle event for the Steven Walter
  Children's Cancer Foundation, hosted from Thredbo each year and attracted
  1000's of motorcycles. Unfortunately it has since ceased to operate. 


  However, we're not letting "officially ended" get in the way of an awesome weekend trip and this one follows our last ride for the charity, in which we attempted (and succeeded) to hit all "checkpoints" in one day. Original rules were to get a stamp at 3 checkpoints to enter into the raffle for a Goldwing on Saturday night in Thredbo. Having all 8 didn't help us win anything, just bragging rights

**Friday**\
Meet up point is Captains Flat Pub mid afternoon, then backroads along the Tindery ranges to Nimmitabel before a fun glide down Brown Mountain. From Bemboka, cross country through Candelo and onto Merimbula for the overnight. *(Approx. 250KMs)*

**Saturday;** the real redux ride day. 

Each of these stops were checkpoints from the original snowy ride. 

1. Heading out of Merimbula, up Mount Darragh, through to Bombala.
2. Cross country via Mafra and on into Cooma
3. Backroads from Cooma, through Shannons Flat and into Adaminaby
4. Around the East side of Lake Eucumbene from Adaminaby to Berridale.
5. Berridale, through to Dalgety by Rockwell Road
   (Dalgety Road if it's been raining, as there's a low causeway at the end of Rockwell that's tricky and deep when river is up).
6. Dalgety to Jindabyne on The Snowy River Way. A few decent twisties, coming up out of Beloka. 
7. Jindabyne to Charlottes Pass; another great section of road coming up from Lake Jindabyne to the park toll booths. 
8. Charlottes Pass back to Jindy for a cold beer, some good yarns and the overnight stop.

*(Approx. 400KMs)*

**Sunday**\
Realistically can be a "choose your own adventure" coming home. Per the route on the map, the intent is to follow the Alpine Way through to Khancoban then turn onto Tooma Road. From there follow Tooma Road onto Elliot Way and get tired (if possible) of all the twisties back to the Snowy Mountain Highway. and follow through to Tumut. At Tumut, head East through the Brindabellas and back to Canberra.
*(Approx. 450KMs)*

***Some alternate options:***

1. At Tumut, follow the Tumut / Murrumbidgee River through to Jugiong. 
2. From Khancoban, turn onto Swampy Plains Road and over the dam walls through to the Snowy Mountains Highway instead of Elliot Way.
3. On Snowy Mountains Highway, turn right for Adaminaby and come into Canberra via Tharwa on Bobeyan Road.
